Does your project run without error?:

Yes

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

I did not encounter any errors in my final tests.





Additional comments to the grader:

I took the requirements for coordinate entry very strictly. I was not sure if he wanted us to accept reverse coordinate
entries such as A:A5-A1. As I was unsure I based my validation solely off of his examples provided in the readme.
In addition I collect input from the page rather than with input pop-ups. The final score board is displayed
right after one user wins. It is loaded from a json array stored in local storage. In order to ensure score board never
goes past 10 players I trim the worst score off of the array when it becomes greater than size 10. Similarly, in order
to stop recording new players  on the leaderboard after its been filled with perfect scores I keep a perfect_score variable in
local storage. Once the count reaches 10 I stop saving scores, however the scoreboard will be displayed regardless.

Please let me know if you run into any issues running my project.

Thank you, Zach
